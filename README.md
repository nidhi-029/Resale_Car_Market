## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project predicts the *resale value of used cars* using machine learning.  
It helps *customers* and *dealerships* make better pricing decisions by analyzing factors like:  
- Mileage  
- Fuel type  
- Engine size  
- Ownership history  
- Transmission type  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to study price trends.  
- Apply *feature engineering* & encode categorical variables.  
- Build and train *ML models* for car price prediction.  
- Deploy a *Streamlit web application* for real-time predictions.  

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- *Programming Language:* Python  
- *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- *Machine Learning Models:* Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Linear Regression  
- *Deployment:* Streamlit  
- *Development Tools:* Google Colab, VS Code

## ðŸ“Š Workflow  
1. *Data Collection & Cleaning*  
   - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and fix outliers.  
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Visualize correlations between car features and prices.  
3. *Feature Engineering*  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., fuel type, seller type).  
   - Scale numerical values.  
4. *Model Training*  
   - Train models like Random Forest & Gradient Boosting.  
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like RÂ² score & RMSE.  
5. *Deployment*  
   - Build a *Streamlit app* to take user inputs and predict car prices instantly.  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results  
- Achieved a *highly accurate ML model* for predicting car prices.  
- Identified *key factors* influencing resale value: mileage, fuel type, engine size, and ownership.  
- Built an *interactive web app* for real-time predictions.
